# Supervised-learning


**This repository is not intended to be used as a ML library**. Rather, the purpose is to be used as a way to study ML models and the common operations defined in ML. You can think of this repository as a self guided workbook for ML.

This repository can also be seen as a Python workbook, since you would get familiar with building a Python library as you go through.

## Your Task

What you should do is that you should implement the library. The library consist in the implementation of 4 clasic supervised models and common operations of ML. You will notice that you are given the test cases for each of the implementaions required. Please report an issue if you find that a test case is wrong. To start, please do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-workbooks/supervised-learning.git
cd supervised-learning
pip install -e ".[dev]
