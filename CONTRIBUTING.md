# Contributing

Thanks for making it this far! Here are some guidelines for the type of contributions we expect in order of complexity. Anyone that contributes in any of the two is considered a collaborator.

1. **Responding to issues**

Issues can be completely arbitrary, so helping us going through them is of great help. We envision the following cases:
- You could check if the issue is already solved and point the user in the right direction.
- You could see if a feature request fits into the workbook and make a PR to update the upcomming features section in this document.
- If it is a unsolved bug, leave it open for someone to work on the PR.


2. **Making PRs**

The best way of making PRs is by first [gaining access to the repo with the answers](https://forms.gle/atFNQEUxryN72L189) and make the PRs there, that way we can integrate the whole workflow. However, we appreciate if you want to contribute in any way that is most convenient for you. We just ask you to do not reveal implementation details in your PRs or issues. The following are valid reasons to make a PR:

- Solve a bug reported as issue (including typos).
- Improve documentation.
- Improve tests.
- Implement one of the upcomming features described bellow (being a collaborator is required, since any PR would required to reveal implementation).
